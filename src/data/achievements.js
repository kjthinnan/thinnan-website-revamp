    title: "Featured by Location Innovation Hub",
    description: "thinnan recognized by LIH for innovative use of location data to connect communities through food.",
    longDescription: "We're proud to have thinnan featured by Location Innovation Hub. Being an early-stage startup, it means a lot to find partners who believe in your vision. LIH has done just that — not only by offering access to insightful data and information that helps us grow, but by connecting us with an incredible network of people and opportunities. Through this collaboration, we've been able to connect with Gispo, participate in the Geospatial Challenge Camp run by Aalto University and University of Turku, and tap into an ecosystem of innovation. We're currently working on refining thinnan based on user feedback and preparing to launch in a new city. The data and insight we've gained through LIH will continue to guide us through this next exciting phase. The LIH team shared: 'We're excited to help our clients to expand into global markets! thinnan's mission is to bring people together through a social network centered around food and real-life personal connections. The company turned to Location Innovation Hub to get a better understanding on how to use location data more effectively which helped their efforts to expand beyond Finland.'",

    title: "Design Interrupted Panel Discussion",
    description: "Our co-founder Annu Mathew joined a panel on 'Climate Breakdown' with Indy Johar, Marco Steinberg and Hella Hernberg.",
    longDescription: "Our co-founder Annu Mathew recently shared the stage of 'Design Interrupted' with Indy Johar, Marco Steinberg and Hella Hernberg. A thought-provoking session on 'Climate Breakdown' emphasised the role every individual has to play in the sustenance of the planet. The panel discussion explored design not just as a tool for problem-solving, but as a way of thinking - a lens through which we navigate complexity and reimagine possibilities. Annu reflected: 'As a fresh design graduate, but also someone who has already worked in the field, stepping into this space was both humbling and exhilarating. Indy challenged us with big questions: What is design? What does it mean to be a designer in today's world?' At thinnan, we strive our best to practice a way of thinking based on the principles of design, focusing on social sustainability and social capital through the medium of food.",

    title: "Innovation Lab Panel Discussion",
    description: "Our co-founder Vishnu Aravind joined a panel on sustainable business and entrepreneurship.",
    longDescription: "Last week, our co-founder Vishnu Aravind took the stage along with Bahez Karim, Olivia Matinlauri & Roberta Robin Gilardi to discuss insights on sustainable business and entrepreneurship. Vishnu highlighted that 'sustainability is indeed a very hot topic, so hot that it is often misunderstood and misinformed! When it comes to thinnan, we are focusing on social sustainability. We believe that while the world focused immensely over environmental sustainability, the social sustainability factor was left behind.' The panel was hosted by START Helsinki and the Chamber of Commerce Finland-Switzerland as part of the Innovation Lab: From Ideas to Impact event, providing a great experience for learning from fellow startup journeys.",
